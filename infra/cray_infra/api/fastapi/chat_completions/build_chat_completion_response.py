Wrap the worker's flat result dict into the OpenAI ChatCompletion
shape the `AsyncOpenAI` SDK expects.

The worker (see `create_generate_worker.async_completion_task`)
returns:

    {
      "request_id": "<id>",
      "response": "<text>",            # present on success
      "error": "<message>",            # present on failure
      "token_count": <int>,            # total_tokens from vLLM
      "prompt_tokens": <int>,          # split from vLLM usage
      "completion_tokens": <int>,      # split from vLLM usage
      "is_acked": True,                # added by update_and_ack
      ...                              # original request fields
    }

We prefer the prompt/completion split when both are present and
recompute `total_tokens` from the sum so the OpenAI `usage` object is
internally consistent. When only `token_count` is available (older
worker, or a code path that didn't propagate the split), we fall back
to attributing it all to `completion_tokens` so `total_tokens` stays
accurate even if the split is approximate.
