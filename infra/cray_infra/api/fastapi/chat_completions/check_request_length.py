"""
Pre-admission length check for the chat completions queue.

vLLM doesn't reject prompts that exceed the per-request KV budget —
the scheduler queues them, can never find a window where they fit,
and the request stalls forever. The /inference browser shows them
as `in_progress` indefinitely; clients see heartbeat whitespace
followed by a timeout. This helper rejects them up front so the
client gets HTTP 400 with a clear reason instead.

The check is a pure threshold computation; the handler is responsible
for getting `prompt_tokens` from a tokenizer it already loaded for
chat-template rendering. Splitting concerns this way keeps the
threshold logic trivially unit-testable without a real tokenizer.
