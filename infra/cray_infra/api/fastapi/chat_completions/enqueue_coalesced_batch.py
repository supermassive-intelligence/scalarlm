"""
Coalescer flush callback: turn one in-memory batch into one queue row.

The coalescer hands us a list of `(request_dict, correlation_id)`
tuples. We serialize the request dicts to a JSON file under
`upload_base_path`, name the file by the SHA-256 of its contents
(matching the existing `/v1/generate` upload path's dedup property),
and call `push_into_queue` to register a single SQLite row pointing
at that file.

The correlation id for each request is already inside the request
dict (the handler put it there before submitting to the coalescer)
so the worker can preserve it across the queue boundary; we don't
re-store it separately here.

See docs/openai-chat-completions-queue.md §6.3.
