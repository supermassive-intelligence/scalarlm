"""Decide how to handle packed-document attention masking per batch/model.

The trainer packs short documents into one block and builds a 4D
block-diagonal+causal attention mask ``[B, 1, S, S]`` so packed documents don't
attend across each other (see ``pack()`` in
``dataset/load_language_model_dataset.py`` and ``training_step_accumulate`` in
``training_loop.py``). Plain text decoders (Llama, Qwen, Gemma3ForCausalLM)
accept the 4D mask.

But some ``...ForConditionalGeneration`` wrappers compute their loss internally
and index the logits by a *2D* attention_mask. Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration
does ``shift_logits[shift_attention_mask != 0]`` (transformers
``modeling_gemma3.py``); handed a 4D mask that index is 4D and raises
``IndexError: too many indices for tensor of dimension 3`` — the gemma-3-4b-it
TRAIN_FAILED in the cuda-spark fine-tune sweep. For those models we fall back to
the 2D padding mask. The documented cost is that packed documents attend across
each other (identical to the existing seq-len-cap fallback); for the
single-document memorization sweep the 4D mask is a no-op anyway. See
docs/reports/2026-06-22-finetune-sweep-multimodal-depth.md.
